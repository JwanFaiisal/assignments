Feature: Arithmetic Operations
  As a user
  I want to perform simple arithmetic operations
  So that I can verify the calculator works correctly

  @smoke @positive
  Scenario: Addition of two positive numbers
    Given the calculator is open
    When the user adds 5 and 7
    Then the result should be 12

  @negative
  Scenario: Subtraction resulting in a negative number
    Given the calculator is open
    When the user subtracts 10 from 5
    Then the result should be -5

  @negative
  Scenario: Division by zero (error case)
    Given the calculator is open
    When the user divides 10 by 0
    Then an error message should be displayed
    But the calculator should not crash
